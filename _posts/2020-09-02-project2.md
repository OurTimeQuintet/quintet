<b>Our Time Wind Quintet</b> is thrilled to perform on Natalie Vargas Nedvetsky’s <b>Literary Music Series</b>! Please join us for this livestream event on <b>November 6, 2020</b>, as we present our recordings of quintet works by Gyorgy Ligeti, Carl Nielsen, and Valerie Coleman.  Joined by award-winning fictional author and poet <b>Patricia McCrystal</b>, we will explore themes of isolation and unity, rediscovery and reinvention, and creativity within confinement through the music in the program. 

There will be a post-performance <b>Zoom Salon</b> following the program in which the audience can interact with the musicians. Please join us as we discuss the process of collaborating and recording remotely, and much more.
