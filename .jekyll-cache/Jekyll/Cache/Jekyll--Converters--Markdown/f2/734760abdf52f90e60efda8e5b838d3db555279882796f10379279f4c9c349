I"T<p>We are excited to be part of Natalie Vargas Nedvetsky’s Literary Music Series. The Literary Music Series “champions the joining of all art forms and promotes their integration into the way we think and live our lives.”</p>

<p>We will be exploring themes of unity, isolation, and what is at stake if we don’t choose to neglect the hard conversations with fictional author and poet <a href="http://www.patriciamccrystal.com">Patricia McCrystal</a>.</p>

<p>More details to come!</p>

<p>Check out the series here: <a href="https://www.literarymusic.org/">Literary Music Series</a></p>
