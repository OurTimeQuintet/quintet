I"?<h1>Hello Friends!</h1>

<p>We did it. Amidst all that is happening in the world, we want to welcome you into OUR TIME.  We hope to start an authentic and joyful musical dialogue with you—bringing notes written years ago and just yesterday vitality and presence. 
We have been working remotely and adapting to digital collaboration. Though it may not be the same as being there in person, we believe that our programming offers a different kind of intimacy than the stage.  During a time filled with days of reflection, inspiration, frustration, and confusion feeling connected through a shared experience is unmeasurable.</p>

<h1>We hope you join us as our journey unfurls. Let’s explore OUR TIME together.</h1>
